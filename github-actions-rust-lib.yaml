# Based on https://github.com/actions-rs/meta/blob/master/recipes/quickstart.md
#
# - Added a cron schedule to run every week. This is particularly helpful
#   for the clippy step, since new releases of Rust tend to introduce
#   new warnings (which in this configuration are treated as errors).
#
# - Shortened name so that in the github summary UI you can see the job
#   names (otherwise they get cut off).
#
# - Add doc job.
#
# - Added rust-cache which speeds up rebuilds a lot.
